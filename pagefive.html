	<a name ="q1"> <h1>enders sister</h1></a>
	<p><font size="5">Born in 13 BX, Valentine Wiggin was the second child and only daughter of John Paul and Theresa Wiggin.[1] Her middle name, Sophia, was given to her by her father in tribute to his mother's favorite sister.[3] Valentine adored her younger brother Andrew, who she nicknamed "Ender' due to her inability to pronounce his name correctly. Valentine had a very tender relationship with Ender and taught him arithmetic when he was three years old. At a very young age, Valentine was given a monitor device from the International Fleet. However, she did not qualify for Battle School due to her compassionate nature, and the monitor was removed from her neck when she was three.[1]</font></p>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	<a name = "q2"><h1>how old is Ender</h1></a>
	<p><font size ="5">Ender, now ten years old, is promoted to Command School on Eros after a brief respite on Earth. After some preliminary battles in the simulator, he is introduced to a former war hero, Mazer Rackham. From now on, Ender participates in simulations created and controlled by Mazer.In the book, Ender was 6 when he left Earth for Battle School and 11 by the time of the *ahem* "final examination" battle. I haven't actually seen the movie to know if it actually states Ender's age, but the film-makers have said Ender in the movie is 12.</font></p>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	<a name="q4"><h1>ender chosen</h1></a>
	<p><font size="5">Not only is he smarter than average, he is smarter than any other child at Battle School, including Ender Wiggin. Despite Bean's intelligence, Ender has been chosen to save humanity from the Buggers.Ender is surprised, because they have already taken away his monitor, but Graff explains that that was his final test and that he has passed. ... Graff wants Ender to choose to come to school because he will not do well if he does not go willingly.</font></p>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	<a name="q5"> <h1>buggers</h1></a>
	<p><font size="5">The Formics, also known as Buggers, are a fictional ant-like alien species from the Ender's Game series of science fiction novels by Orson Scott Card. According to the novel canon, the Formics attacked Earth 50 years before the novel begins.And they forgive us for killing them all. The final straw: the buggers only killed a few humans and “never deliberately attacked a civilian population” (14.331), whereas Ender purposefully destroyed their entire planet. Talk about a study in contrasts… The buggers are basically really nice aliens.</font></p>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	<a name="q6"> <h1>communication?</h1></a>
	<p><font size ="5">They became fearful of Ender from his brutal brilliance in the game and his self-image as brutal that the game could sense, and became convinced that he was capable of destroying them all.Ender leaves with Valentine because at least once he gets to the bugger world he will be on his own. ... The buggers understood Ender better than anyone else, because they saw his thoughts, and so they know not only that will he help them but that he wants to help them.</font></p>
