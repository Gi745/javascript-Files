<h1> ENDERS GAME</h1>

<p style=" color:white;">This movie is about a young boy called Ender. He lives in a place where the human race is fighting some aliens known as Buggers. Ender was taken away from home and put in a military station where he was trained to fight the Buggers. During this he was forced to play simulation games in which he would try to defeat a enemy and to defeat buggers. <p> 
<p style="color:white;">After some years of Ender being inside the military facilitiy he became one of the best individuals in there. In one point the main officers came to get him for another game simulation and with his teamates he won the sim which later turned out to be a real combat and he destroyed the burggers colony. He was later known as a hero and as a killer.</p>
<br><p style="color:yellow;"> I like this movie because its an action movie that has so many turn of events and is full of mysterious features.</p>
